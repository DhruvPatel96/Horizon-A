Horizon-A: Soil Analysis Application"

Welcome to the official GitHub repository of Horizon-A, a groundbreaking solution in the realm of modern agriculture. Developed by Dhruv Kumar Arvind Patel and Anureet Kaur, this application reimagines soil analysis, revolutionizing the way farmers approach crop recommendations and resource management.

üå± Abstract:
Horizon-A offers accelerated soil analysis capabilities that have a profound impact on agricultural practices. By harnessing deep learning algorithms and image processing techniques, this application provides real-time insights into soil composition, pH levels, nutrient richness, and texture. The result? Personalized fertilizer recommendations, crop selection guidance, and soil maintenance strategies that enhance yields and resource efficiency.

üåæ Motivation:
Existing soil analysis solutions often fall short, relying on simplistic methods or demanding extensive user input. Horizon-A is born from the need for a comprehensive, accurate, and user-friendly application that combines cutting-edge technology with agricultural science. Its motivation is to bridge the gap between soil analysis, data-driven decision-making, and sustainable farming practices.

üìö Background Study:
Soil analysis is pivotal for effective farming. This application delves into the significance of soil composition, color analysis inspired by astronomical spectroscopy, and the integration of color and texture insights. By extracting valuable data from soil images, Horizon-A creates a holistic understanding of soil attributes, offering actionable recommendations for fertilizer use, crop selection, and soil health maintenance.

üöÄ Approach and Model:
Horizon-A's approach is systematically divided into two phases. The first involves image classification, segmentation, and dominant color extraction. The second phase estimates soil nutrition, pH range, and offers personalized recommendations for fertilizers, crops, and general soil management. This orchestrated process harnesses machine learning, data correlation, and cloud storage to streamline soil analysis.

üåê Conclusion and Future Work:
Horizon-A is a game-changer in modern agriculture, paving the way for informed decisions and sustainable practices. While this version marks a significant milestone, the potential for future enhancements is vast. By expanding the dataset, fine-tuning the machine learning model, and exploring additional features, Horizon-A's accuracy and impact can continue to evolve.

This GitHub repository houses both the frontend Android application and the backend machine learning model. Feel free to explore the code, contribute to its development, and be a part of transforming agriculture through innovation.
